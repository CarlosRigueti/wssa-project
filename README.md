# Spotify Tracker

## Overview
This project is part of the Web Services and Applications module for the Data Analytics course at Atlantic Technological University, taught by Andrew Beatty. The Spotify Tracker is a web application that allows users to:

- Perform CRUD operations on Spotify track records stored locally
- Search tracks by artist name
- View track details including album, release date, popularity, duration, and preview link
- Manage a local database of tracks using a Flask backend and SQLite
- Interact with the application through a responsive web interface using Bootstrap and AJAX

- Python 3.7+
- pip package manager

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-tracker.git
   cd spotify-tracker

   Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage Guide
Use the search bar to filter tracks by artist name.

Use the pagination buttons below the table to navigate large lists.

Click Update to edit a track's details.

Click Delete to remove a track.

Click Add Track (if implemented) to add new tracks to the database.

The Play button opens the track preview link in a new tab.

Troubleshooting
Make sure the SQLite database file spotify.db is writable and present in the root directory.

Verify Python packages are installed and up to date.

If the API routes fail, check your Flask app console logs for errors.
