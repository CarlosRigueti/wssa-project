## Overview

- Perform CRUD operations on Spotify track records stored locally
- Search tracks by artist name
- View track details including album, release date, popularity, duration, and preview link
- Manage a local database of tracks using a Flask backend and SQLite
- Interact with the application through a responsive web interface using Bootstrap and AJAX
